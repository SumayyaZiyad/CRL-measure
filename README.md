# CRL-measure
This repository contains the implementation of the CRL measure proposed to evaluate record linkage. This work is currently under review for the Journal of Data and Information Quality (JDIQ).

The `predicted-scores` directory contains the similarity scores obtained for all real-world data sets used in the experimental evaluation.
